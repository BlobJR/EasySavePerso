## Features üåü

### **Version 1** üìú

The software is a **console application** developed using **.NET Core**. It supports the creation of up to **five backup jobs**.  

A job is defined by:  

- **Name** üè∑Ô∏è  
- **Source folder path** üóÇÔ∏è  
- **Target folder path** üìÅ  
- **Backup type**: Complete or Differential üîÑ  

Once the user creates the jobs, they can execute them **individually** or **simultaneously**. The source and target paths can be located on **local, external, or network drives**.  

When backups are executed, the software must generate **two files**:

#### **Daily Log üìÖ**  

- Timestamp ‚è∞  
- Backup name üìù  
- Full source file path üõ£Ô∏è  
- Full destination file path üè†  
- File size üìè  
- File transfer time (in milliseconds) ‚è≥  

#### **Real-time Status üîÑ**  

- Backup type üóÇÔ∏è  
- Timestamp of the last action ‚è±Ô∏è  
- Backup job status (**Active, Inactive, etc.**) üö¶  

If the job is active:  
- Total number of eligible files üìÇ  
- Size of files to be transferred üíæ  
- Progress:  
  - Number of remaining files üìù  
  - Size of remaining files üìä  
  - Full source file path being backed up üîí  
  - Full destination file path üîë

### **Version 2** üîß

#### **Graphical Interface üñ•Ô∏è**
- The console mode is abandoned. The application must now be graphical and based on WPF or a framework of your choice (e.g., Avalonia).

#### **Unlimited Number of Jobs ‚ôæÔ∏è**
- The number of backup jobs is now unlimited.

#### **Encryption via CryptoSoft üîê**
- The software must be able to encrypt files using CryptoSoft (developed during Project 4). Only files with extensions defined by the user in the general settings will be encrypted.

#### **Evolution of the Daily Log File üìà**
- The daily log file must include an additional piece of information:
  - Time required for file encryption (in ms)
    - `0`: no encryption üö´
    - `>0`: encryption time (in ms) ‚è≥
    - `<0`: error code ‚ùå

#### **Business Software üíº**
- If a business software is detected, the software must prevent the launch of a backup job. For sequential jobs, the software must finish backing up the current file.
- The user can define the business software in the general settings of the software. (Note: the calculator application can substitute for business software during demonstrations.)
- The stop must be logged in the log file üìù.
